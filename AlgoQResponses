# Question:
Write pseudocode for an (efficient and correct) algorithm that answers each of the following questions for a pair of BVHs A and B. (You are allowed to assume that the query is available for any kind of leaf nodes.)  Give the time complexity of each algorithm.  For full points, you will need to write legibly in complete sentences.
1. [Do A and B intersect, and where?](#area-intersection)
2. Do the boundaries of A and B intersect, and where?
3. Does A contain B?
4. How close are A and B to being tangent, and at what pair of points?
5. What is point on B closest to any point on A?
